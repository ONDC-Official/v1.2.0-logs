It will also be very helpful for the training of air traffic control officers (ATCOs). The book does not require any prior (specialist) knowledge as it is an introduction to air navigation service provider (ANSP) business. There is very little literature available that gives a detailed appreciation of the complexities, potential risks and issues associated with the provision of air navigation services. The role of this book is to fill this significant gap with  a comprehensive, in-depth study of the management principles related to ANSPs. This is particularly timely given recent ATC developments in Europe, USA and New Zealand. Airlines and airports rely on the ANSPs for the management of air traffic. Hence, air navigation services (ANS) provision is considered as a core element for air transportation.",
