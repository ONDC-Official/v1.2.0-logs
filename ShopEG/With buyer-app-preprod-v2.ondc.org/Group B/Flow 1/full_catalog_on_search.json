Aashirvaad prides itself in making 100% pure whole wheat atta with all its natural dietary fibres intact which ensures that you and your family receive optimum nutrition for a healthy life. Directly sourced from a wide network of Indian rural farmers, Aashirvaad Superior MP Atta is Made in India.

The grain produce goes through a 3-step cleaning process that ensures the best quality of wheat grains. These expertly sourced grains undergo mechanised packaging that ensures zero human contact and 100% safety. To ensure the retention of the wheat’s high nutritional value, the grains are ground using the traditional ‘chakki’ method. This helps locking-in the highest nutritional value in the whole wheat flour. The dietary fibres and natural nutrients help in easy digestion and supporting immunity which are essential for your family’s daily intake. The dough made from Aashirvaad Superior MP Atta absorbs more water which makes sure that the rotis remain softer for a longer period.
