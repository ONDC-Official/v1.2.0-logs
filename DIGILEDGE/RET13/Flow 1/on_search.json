Like our other key ingredient, beeswax, kokkum butter is also non-comedogenic. That is, it does not clog pores. Which makes it a preferred moisturising choice for oily skin and skin with acne. All Forest Post  moisturisers, body butters and body rubs are made of 100% natural ingredients and are safe for facial application. ",
