Rectified below issues:

inconsistency between /on_confirm & unsolicited on_cancel:
 /on_confirm, there are 2 items (57759, 59823), each with qty 2; however, /on_cancel items array shows qty 3 for 59007??
if there's RTO delivery charge being added, it should also be added to quote_trail for the fulfillment;
