don’t miss them while you’re doing something else. You can see who’s calling, track your next ride, check your flight
status, and so much more.\nINNOVATIVE DESIGN — iPhone 15 features a durable color-infused glass and aluminum design.
It’s splash, water, and dust resistant. The Ceramic Shield front is tougher than any smartphone glass. And the 6.1\"
Super Retina XDR display is up to 2x brighter in the sun compared to iPhone 14.\n48MP MAIN CAMERA WITH 2X TELEPHOTO —
The 48MP Main camera shoots in super-high resolution. So it’s easier than ever to take standout photos with amazing
detail. The 2x optical-quality Telephoto lets you frame the perfect close-up.\nNEXT-GENERATION PORTRAITS — Capture
portraits with dramatically more detail and color. Just tap to shift the focus between subjects — even after you take
the shot.\nPOWERHOUSE A16 BIONIC CHIP — The superfast chip powers advanced features like computational photography,
fluid Dynamic Island transitions, and Voice Isolation for phone calls. And A16 Bionic is incredibly efficient to help
