1. Reverse Geocoding Issues (search_0)

We are not sure why the area codes are not matching with the provided latitude-longitude pairs.
We have checked on our end, and both the start and end locations appear correct us.

2. Weight Mismatch (confirm_0 & on_confirm_0)

The utility assumes that the total order weight is the sum of the individual item weights.
However, our rule logic also factors in packaging and handling weight, which accounts for the difference. 
In this case, the system-calculated weight (2.1 kg) includes packaging materials such as the cardboard box. 
Changing this logic would introduce handling weight differential cases, which may not be ideal for our process.

3. Missing Shipping Label (on_update_0)

The shipping label requirement is managed by the LSP. 
In our workflow, labels are typically provided during the on_status event. 
Since this is under the LSPâ€™s control, there is not much we can do here.
