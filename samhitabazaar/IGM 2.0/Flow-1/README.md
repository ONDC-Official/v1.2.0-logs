## IGM 2.0 FLOW-1 Validation Report

### Issue

**1. `missing_ref_fulfilment`**: Reference type `'FULFILMENT'` is mandatory for FLOW\_1 but is missing.

**Explanation**:
This appears to be a spelling mistake in the ONDC Utility Validation Tool. However, the reference type is correctly defined as `'FULFILLMENT'` in **Pramaan**. Therefore, I have followed the Pramaan specification.
