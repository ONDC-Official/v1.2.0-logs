Previous issues persist here - 


following were the issues we received  after the first log submission

Why two on_cancels are provided, could you please explain this ? --> This was fixed in  the second submission
tags are missing for backward fulfillments in the items for customized item and customization --> was fixed
if the quote_trail price is 0 for any item, shouldn’t be added in the quote_trail ---> was already fixed
Are you not charging any fees, as the order is already out for delivery ? --> No
subtype should be use in the quote_trail if the customization is associated either with ‘tax’ or ‘item’ or ‘customization’ --> for item tax,  subtype was missing and have updated it

Doubt : So by Previous issues persist here , did you mean the subtype missing issue?
