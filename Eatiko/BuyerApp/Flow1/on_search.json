                "long_desc": "\"•\tTHICK CONSISTENCY: This mouth-watering chutney has a slightly thick consistency due to the tamarind pulp. It’s easy to scoop out of the jar, and just one scoop is enough to elevate the taste of your snacks. Just drizzle it over your samosa and get an instant tangy punch.\n•\tTHE FLAVOR OF INDIA: Because we make our products at home using the recipe passed down from our mom and grandmom, you can rest assured that you’ll get only the authentic taste of saunth chutney. The overall hit of the flavour will be somewhere in the centre of sweet and tangy with a bit of heat in there.\n•\tALL-NATURAL INGREDIENTS: Non-GMO, locally and ethically sourced ingredients and ensure you get a healthy product. We use tamarind pulp, jaggery, sugar, black salt, jeera, chili powder, garam masala, ginger powder, kaju, and raisins to put together this lip-smacking condiment.\n•\tRELISH IT WITH YOUR FAVORITE SNACK: Whether it is dahi bhallay, chaats, dahi vada, moong dal k ladoo, golgappas, cutlets, samosas, pakoras, or just about any fried snack, our tamarind chutney is sure to perk up the taste like nothing else. Saunth chutney jar can be left in the fridge for months. The chutney stays fresh without losing its original taste and flavour.\n•\tGLUTEN-FREE & VEGAN: Our tamarind chutney is low-fat, vegan, and gluten-free. We keep preservatives, artificial flavours, and enhancers out of our recipes. Known to improve digestion, especially after snacking on fried foods. The added nutrition from raisins turns it into a wholesome chutney no ketchup can ever come close to.\n\n\"",

But here are a few universally agreed foods with which Aam ka achar would pair the best. Each bite whether taken with piping hot flatbread, aloo ka paratha, dal, or boiled rice, will unfold almost instantly the entire flavour profile of the zesty Punjabi mango pickle. You will love to have it every day of the week!\n•\tHOMEMADE, AUTHENTIC RECIPE: Our homemade recipe is second to none. It is just how moms & grandmoms would make it back in the day. We first source raw mangoes from the ever-so-green and abundant farms of Punjab just before hardcore summer sets in. We then hand-cut, sun-dried, and marinate the uniformly cut slices with a bunch of spices.\n•\tNON-GMO INGREDIENTS: We use raw mangoes, methi seeds, Fennel-Saunf, Hing-Asafoetida, and Fenugreek-Methi before finally dipping the mixture in mustard oil and leaving it to mature for up to four weeks. All the ingredients are natural, locally sourced, and non-GMO.\n•\tHEALTHY & NUTRITIOUS: You get a pungent, full-bodied fermented flavour that is just the perfect accompaniment to your favourite meals. A low-cholesterol side dish brimming with iron, vitamin A and fibres. Tasty, healthy, and nutritious, how you would like it.\n\n\"",
