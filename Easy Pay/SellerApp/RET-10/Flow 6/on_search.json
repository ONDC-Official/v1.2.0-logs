We handpicked our Almonds directly from the farms of Kashmir. They are cleaned rigorously and then sun dried non-roasted nuts for the best flavor and aroma.\n\n \n\nOur Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil is pure, Organic, Chemical-free, preservative free and Gluten free. We process the Almonds/ Badam in a wooden Kohlu/pestle or Kachi Ghani that presses the nuts and crushes them for extracting the oil at room temperature. All this is done at a low temperature to keep the temperature of the entire process below 40 degrees. The wood pestle absorbs any increase in temperature and does not generate heat through friction. This technique helps us keep the nutrition maintained in the oil. Once the Oil is extracted, the oil settles for 2-3 days following which, we sieve filter the Almond oil.\n\n \n\nBenefits:\n\nSprouted Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil is pure and organic hence it will be used less in quantity for cooking as compared with refined oils. Other benefits are:\n\n \n\nContain good amount of Polyunsaturated fats which are good for your health\nNuts are pressed and crushed at the same time so the Oil is not refined or polished with chemicals\nHelp in lowering blood sugar levels and improves digestion\nA good source of antioxidants which protect the body from disease\npromotes healthy heart\nTraditional method of extraction keeping all nutrients intact\nCompletely Natural with zero chemicals, aroma or flavor\nGood source of Vitamin E and antioxidants\nGood for Skincare and hair care and massage(s)\n \n\nOur Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil can be used for dressing, sauteing, seasoning, skincare, haircare, and massage(s).\n\nSTORAGE INSTRUCTIONS: Our Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil is best stored in a cool and dry place with the lid tightly closed.\n\nPACKAGE CONTENT: 1 Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil; Quantity: 100 ML; Diet Type: Vegetarian; Shelf Life: 365 Days.

                "long_desc": "Our premium quality Almonds/ Badam produced in India is extracted using a fusion of traditional Wood Cold Pressed Method with modern technology for extraction. We handpicked our Almonds directly from the farms of Kashmir. They are cleaned rigorously and then sun dried non-roasted nuts for the best flavor and aroma.\n\n \n\nOur Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil is pure, Organic, Chemical-free, preservative free and Gluten free. We process the Almonds/ Badam in a wooden Kohlu/pestle or Kachi Ghani that presses the nuts and crushes them for extracting the oil at room temperature. All this is done at a low temperature to keep the temperature of the entire process below 40 degrees. The wood pestle absorbs any increase in temperature and does not generate heat through friction. This technique helps us keep the nutrition maintained in the oil. Once the Oil is extracted, the oil settles for 2-3 days following which, we sieve filter the Almond oil.\n\n \n\nBenefits:\n\nSprouted Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil is pure and organic hence it will be used less in quantity for cooking as compared with refined oils. Other benefits are:\n\n \n\nContain good amount of Polyunsaturated fats which are good for your health\nNuts are pressed and crushed at the same time so the Oil is not refined or polished with chemicals\nHelp in lowering blood sugar levels and improves digestion\nA good source of antioxidants which protect the body from disease\npromotes healthy heart\nTraditional method of extraction keeping all nutrients intact\nCompletely Natural with zero chemicals, aroma or flavor\nGood source of Vitamin E and antioxidants\nGood for Skincare and hair care and massage(s)\n \n\nOur Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil can be used for dressing, sauteing, seasoning, skincare, haircare, and massage(s).\n\nSTORAGE INSTRUCTIONS: Our Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil is best stored in a cool and dry place with the lid tightly closed.\n\nPACKAGE CONTENT: 1 Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil; Quantity: 100 ML; Diet Type: Vegetarian; Shelf Life: 365 Days.

                "short_desc": "The hard anodised models have all the features and benefits of the Hawkins Contura Pressure Cooker in a hard anodised body and stainless-steel lid. The beautiful, durable black finish given by 60 microns thick hard anodising has two benefits. It makes the pressure cooker absorb heat faster, making it more energy efficient. And the pressure cooker stays looking new for years. Recommended for use on gas stoves. What is Hard Anodising? Russian scientists first developed hard anodising to produce a metal surface tough enough for space travel. Hawkins now uses the same technology to make its Hard Anodised pressure cookers and cookware. Through a process of electrolysis at sub-zero temperature using a high-intensity electric current, a 60-micron thick layer of aluminium oxide (Al2O3) is formed molecule by molecule as an integral part of the metal. This process produces a surface harder than steel with wonderful properties for cooking. The Hard Anodised surface is non-toxic, non-staining and non-reactive with foods. It is thermal-efficient, heats fast and evenly and is not spoiled by high heat. It is tough and durable, will not tarnish or corrode and will stay looking new for years. Ideal for 5 or 7 persons. \n\nFeatures & Benefits: \n\nNew improved pressure regulator\nOperates at 1 kg/cm2 (15 pounds / square inch) pressure.\nPressure-locked Safety lid – cannot be opened while there is pressure inside.\nSafety valve under lid handlebar for greater safety\nHard anodised body - thermal efficient; heats fast and evenly\nCooks faster - save more fuel.\nWill not pit, tarnish, or corrode – stays looking new for years.\nNon-toxic, non-staining – does not react with foods.",

Aashirvaad prides itself in making 100% pure whole wheat atta with all its natural dietary fibres intact which ensure that you and your family receive optimum nutrition for a healthy life. Directly sourced from a wide network of Indian rural farmers, Aashirvaad Superior MP Atta is Made in India.

The grain produce goes through a 3-step cleaning process that ensures the best quality of wheat grains. These expertly sourced grains undergo mechanised packaging that ensures zero human contact and 100% safety. To ensure the retention of the wheat’s high nutritional value, the grains are ground using the traditional ‘chakki’ method. This helps locking-in the highest nutritional value in whole wheat flour. The dietary fibres and natural nutrients help in easy digestion and supporting immunity which is essential for your family’s daily intake. The dough made from Aashirvaad Superior MP Atta absorbs more water which makes sure that the rotis remain softer for a longer period. You and your family can lead a fit and healthier lifestyle as you enjoy soft, fluffy and delicious rotis from this naturally protein-rich whole wheat atta.",

A single, compact attachment on your Nutri-blend that chops, slices, makes juliennes and even kneads your dough with impressive speed and precision. Instead of many separate appliances, you now need only one. The 400W superfast motor blends, grinds, juices and chops in seconds. Motor unit is very steady and safe to use. Non-skid rubber footing stabilises the base. Powerful motor handles multiple prep jobs: slicing vegetables, grating cheese, mixing batters, kneading dough, pureeing soups and chopping onions, herbs or nuts.Care Instructions: Don't run the Nutri-blend for more than 1 minute at a time. Give it a 3 minute break before using again for best performance. For most applications, 20-40 seconds of operation would be enough. Do not use blending blade for dry grinding.",
