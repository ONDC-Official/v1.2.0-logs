The beautiful, durable black finish given by 60 microns thick hard anodising has two benefits. It makes the pressure cooker absorb heat faster, making it more energy efficient. And the pressure cooker stays looking new for years. Recommended for use on gas stoves. What is Hard Anodising? Russian scientists first developed hard anodising to produce a metal surface tough enough for space travel. Hawkins now uses the same technology to make its Hard Anodised pressure cookers and cookware. Through a process of electrolysis at sub-zero temperature using a high-intensity electric current, a 60-micron thick layer of aluminium oxide (Al2O3) is formed molecule by molecule as an integral part of the metal. This process produces a surface harder than steel with wonderful properties for cooking. The Hard Anodised surface is non-toxic, non-staining and non-reactive with foods. It is thermal-efficient, heats fast and evenly and is not spoiled by high heat. It is tough and durable, will not tarnish or corrode and will stay looking new for years. Ideal for 5 or 7 persons. \n\nFeatures & Benefits: \n\nNew improved pressure regulator\nOperates at 1 kg/cm2 (15 pounds / square inch) pressure.\nPressure-locked Safety lid – cannot be opened while there is pressure inside.\nSafety valve under lid handlebar for greater safety\nHard anodised body - thermal efficient; heats fast and evenly\nCooks faster - save more fuel.\nWill not pit, tarnish, or corrode – stays looking new for years.\nNon-toxic, non-staining – does not react with foods.",

Behind every Aashirvaad pack are the Indian farmers and Aashirvaad experts who’ve made the atta with extra care. Aashirvaad prides itself in making 100% pure whole wheat atta with all its natural dietary fibres intact which ensure that you and your family receive optimum nutrition for a healthy life. Directly sourced from a wide network of Indian rural farmers, Aashirvaad Superior MP Atta is Made in India. They are showered with just the right amount of rain and sun-kissed to perfection which allows the grains to be heavy on the palm and amber in colour. The grain produce goes through a 3-step cleaning process that ensures the best quality of wheat grains. These expertly sourced grains undergo mechanised packaging that ensures zero human contact and 100% safety. To ensure the retention of the wheat’s high nutritional value, the grains are ground using the traditional ‘chakki’ method. This helps locking-in the highest nutritional value in whole wheat flour. The dietary fibres and natural nutrients help in easy digestion and supporting immunity which is essential for your family’s daily intake. The dough made from Aashirvaad Superior MP Atta absorbs more water which makes sure that the rotis remain softer for a longer period. You and your family can lead a fit and healthier lifestyle as you enjoy soft, fluffy and delicious rotis from this naturally protein-rich whole wheat atta.",

                "short_desc": "Launched on 27th May 2002, Aashirvaad Whole Wheat Atta has now become number one in branded packaged atta across the country. Behind every Aashirvaad pack are the Indian farmers and Aashirvaad experts who’ve made the atta with extra care. Aashirvaad prides itself in making 100% pure whole wheat atta with all its natural dietary fibres intact which ensure that you and your family receive optimum nutrition for a healthy life. Directly sourced from a wide network of Indian rural farmers, Aashirvaad Superior MP Atta is Made in India. They are showered with just the right amount of rain and sun-kissed to perfection which allows the grains to be heavy on the palm and amber in colour. The grain produce goes through a 3-step cleaning process that ensures the best quality of wheat grains. These expertly sourced grains undergo mechanised packaging that ensures zero human contact and 100% safety. To ensure the retention of the wheat’s high nutritional value, the grains are ground using the traditional ‘chakki’ method. This helps locking-in the highest nutritional value in whole wheat flour. The dietary fibres and natural nutrients help in easy digestion and supporting immunity which is essential for your family’s daily intake. The dough made from Aashirvaad Superior MP Atta absorbs more water which makes sure that the rotis remain softer for a longer period. You and your family can lead a fit and healthier lifestyle as you enjoy soft, fluffy and delicious rotis from this naturally protein-rich whole wheat atta.",
