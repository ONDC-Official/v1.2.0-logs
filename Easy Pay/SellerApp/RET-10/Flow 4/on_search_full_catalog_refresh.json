Our Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil is pure, Organic, Chemical-free, preservative free and Gluten free. We process the Almonds/ Badam in a wooden Kohlu/pestle or Kachi Ghani that presses the nuts and crushes them for extracting the oil at room temperature. All this is done at a low temperature to keep the temperature of the entire process below 40 degrees. The wood pestle absorbs any increase in temperature and does not generate heat through friction. This technique helps us keep the nutrition maintained in the oil. Once the Oil is extracted, the oil settles for 2-3 days following which, we sieve filter the Almond oil.     Benefits:  Sprouted Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil is pure and organic hence it will be used less in quantity for cooking as compared with refined oils. Other benefits are:     Contain good amount of Polyunsaturated fats which are good for your health Nuts are pressed and crushed at the same time so the Oil is not refined or polished with chemicals Help in lowering blood sugar levels and improves digestion A good source of antioxidants which protect the body from disease promotes healthy heart Traditional method of extraction keeping all nutrients intact Completely Natural with zero chemicals, aroma or flavor Good source of Vitamin E and antioxidants Good for Skincare and hair care and massage(s)    Our Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil can be used for dressing, sauteing, seasoning, skincare, haircare, and massage(s).

Aashirvaad prides itself in making 100% pure whole wheat atta with all its natural dietary fibres intact which ensure that you and your family receive optimum nutrition for a healthy life.

The grain produce goes through a 3-step cleaning process that ensures the best quality of wheat grains. These expertly sourced grains undergo mechanised packaging that ensures zero human contact and 100% safety. To ensure the retention of the wheat\u2019s high nutritional value, the grains are ground using the traditional \u2018chakki\u2019 method. This helps locking-in the highest nutritional value in whole wheat flour. The dietary fibres and natural nutrients help in easy digestion and supporting immunity which is essential for your family\u2019s daily intake.
