Our Wood Cold Pressed Almond Oil is pure, Organic, Chemical-free, preservative free and Gluten free.

Directly sourced from a wide network of Indian rural farmers, Aashirvaad Superior MP Atta is Made in India.

The grain produce goes through a 3-step cleaning process that ensures the best quality of wheat grains. These expertly sourced grains undergo mechanised packaging that ensures zero human contact and 100% safety. To ensure the retention of the wheats high nutritional value, the grains are ground using the traditional chakki method. This helps locking-in the highest nutritional value in whole wheat flour. The dietary fibres and natural nutrients help in easy digestion and supporting immunity which is essential for your familys daily intake. The dough made from Aashirvaad Superior MP Atta absorbs more water which makes sure that the rotis remain softer for a longer period.
